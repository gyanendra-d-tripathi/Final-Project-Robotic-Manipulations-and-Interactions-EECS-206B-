Abstractâ€” In  this  paper  we  present  our  exploration  of  nonlinear   control   theory   with   emphasis   on   Control   LyapunovFunctions and Control Barrier functions to achieve conflictingobjectives of performance with safety guarantees of autonomouscar and related trade offs. We have designed a controller usingthe  dynamics  of  GRIBOTS  to  achieve  simultaneous  adaptivespeed   regulation   and   lane   keeping   with   safety   guaranteesusing  a  frame  work  where  a  Quadratic  program  is  used  tomediate  the  conflicting  objectives  of  performance  and  safetyby making trade offs in performance while guaranteeing safetyof  autonomous  system.  We  have  used  the  MATLAB  simulatorprovided by the Robotarium for testing our ideas and concept

This project has given us immense learning opportunity to design the control system for autonomous systems using provable safety and performance guarantees.
